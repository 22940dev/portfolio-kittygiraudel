```css
/**
 * 1. Start absolutely positioned in the top right corner of the
 *    container.
 * 2. Horizontal padding is considered in the ribbon placement.
 *    The larger the ribbon (text + padding), the lower in the
 *    container it might have to be.
 * 3. Make sure the content is centered within the ribbon itself.
 * 4. Position the ribbon correctly based on its width, as per
 *    the following formula: `cos(45 * Ï€ / 180) * 100%`.
