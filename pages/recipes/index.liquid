Not everything has to be about coding. I do enjoy cooking (and eating, needless

<ul class="List">
  {% for recipe in collections.recipes %}
  <li class="List__item">
    <div class="List__item-inner">
      <span class="List__secondary-content">
        For {{ recipe.data.serves }} Â· About {{ recipe.data.preparation_time }}
      </span>

      <a class="List__primary-content" href="{{ recipe.url }}">
