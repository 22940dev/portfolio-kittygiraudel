# About me

{% include ad.html %}

I am a French front-end developer based in Berlin. After a couple of years working as a developer in the banking industry, I had the great opportunity to join [Edenspiekermann](http://edenspiekermann.com) in Berlin to work on client projects.

I dare call myself an active open-source community member as I have contributed to many projects, as well as initiated a few of my own as well. Among them, let's mention [Browserhacks](http://browserhacks.com), [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) and [Sass Compatibility](http://sass-compatibility.github.io).

Early 2014, I co-authored with [RaphaÃ«l Goetter](http://goetter.fr) a French book on CSS 3 entitled [CSS 3 Pratique du Design Web](http://css3-pratique.fr/), and I am currently in the process of writing a book on Sass (stay tuned).

I also happen to be one of the 10 nominees for the [Net Awards](https://thenetawards.com) under the [Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/developer/) category. I am not sure why, but I am very proud anyway.

## About this site

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under the [HugoGiraudel / hugogiraudel.github.com](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com) repository. 

The Sass code base respects [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) and sticks to the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). The small Sass public API is commented using [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com) and available [here](/sassdoc/). Moreover, the entire uncompiled stylesheets are heavily commented, so feel free to [have a look](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com/tree/master/_sass).
