I am a French front-end developer based in Berlin. After a couple of years working as a developer in the French banking industry, I had the great opportunity to join [Edenspiekermann](http://edenspiekermann.com) in Berlin to work on client projects. I recently quit to join [N26](https://n26.com/) in order to improve mobile banking in Germany and Europe.

I dare call myself an active open-source community member as I have contributed to many projects, as well as initiated a few of my own as well. Among them, let’s mention [Browserhacks](http://browserhacks.com), [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es), [Simplified JavaScript Jargon](http://jargon.js.org) and [a11y-dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.com/a11y-dialog).

Early 2014, I co-authored with [Raphaël Goetter](http://goetter.fr) a French book on CSS 3 entitled [CSS 3 Pratique du Design Web](http://css3-pratique.fr/). In 2016, I published a book about Sass entitled [Jump Start Sass](https://learnable.com/books/jump-start-sass), with [Miriam Suzanne](http://www.miriamsuzanne.com/).

I’ve used to be a Google Developer Expert in front-end development, and one of the 5 nominees for the [Net Awards](https://thenetawards.com) under the [Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/developer/) category.

You can ask me anything on the [Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/hugogiraudel/ama) repository.

## About this site

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under the [HugoGiraudel / hugogiraudel.github.com](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com) repository. 

The Sass code base respects [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) and sticks to the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). Moreover, the entire uncompiled stylesheets are heavily commented, so feel free to [have a look](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com/tree/master/assets/sass).
