I am a non-binary French web developer based in Berlin.


After a couple of years working as a developer in the banking industry in the French Alps, I relocated to Berlin to join [Edenspiekermann](https://edenspiekermann.com), a design agency. In 2016, I quit to join [N26](https://n26.com/) as a web tech lead where I focus on digital accessibility and inclusion.

I used to be an active open-source community member. I have contributed to many projects, as well as initiated a few of my own as well. Among them, let’s mention [Browserhacks](http://browserhacks.com), [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es), [Simplified JavaScript Jargon](https://jargon.js.org), [a11y-dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.com/a11y-dialog) and [a11y-toggle](https://edenspiekermann.github.com/a11y-toggle).

Early 2014, I authored a French book on CSS 3 entitled [CSS 3 Pratique du Design Web](https://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Livre/css3-9782212678963/) (CSS 3 for Web Design). Two years later, I co-authored a book about Sass entitled [Jump Start Sass](https://learnable.com/books/jump-start-sass) with [Miriam Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/).

I used to be a Google Developer Expert in front-end development, and one of the 5 nominees for the [Net Awards 2015](https://thenetawards.com) under the [Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/developer/) category.

For a more personal glance at my last ten years, be sure to read [A decade in review](/2020/01/01/a-decade-in-review/), and if you have any question, feel free to ask me anything on me [Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/hugogiraudel/ama) repository.

If you’d like to mention me in your article or talk, note that I go by “Hugo” or “Kitty”, and please use “they”/“them” pronouns.
