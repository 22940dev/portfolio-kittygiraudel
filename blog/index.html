<p>I write <em>a lot</em> of articles for different sites. External articles are annotated with an external link icon. Articles with the user icon are guest posts. If you are looking for something specific, hit <a href="/search">the search</a>, or check all <a href="/guest/">guest posts</a>.</p>

<ul class="list">
{% for post in paginator.posts %}
  {% unless post.preview %}
    {% include post-list.html post=post %}
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<ul class="pagination">
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}"><span class="pagination__icon">◀</span> Previous</a>
    </li>
  {% endif %}
  {% if paginator.next_page %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ paginator.next_page_path }}">Next <span class="pagination__icon">►</span></a>
    </li>
  {% endif %}
</ul>
