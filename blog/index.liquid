Over the last few years, I have spent a lot of time writing. Mostly about tech,
but also about some other topics from time to time. If you are looking for
something specific, use [the search](/search). I also had the great opportunity
of having very talented people writing here, so be sure to check all [guest
posts](/guest).

If you‚Äôre looking for something more tasty, you‚Äôll be pleased to know I started
blogging about [my personal recipes](/recipes). üë©‚Äçüç≥
