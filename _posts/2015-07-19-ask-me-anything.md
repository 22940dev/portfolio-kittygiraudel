I recently discovered the _Ask Me Anything_ concept, through the [AMA repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama) of [Sindre Sorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus), the author of countless node modules.

The idea is simple: people can ask questions about basically anything on the repository, to whom the author reply the way they feels. Once a question has been answered, the issue gets closed and that’s it.

It turns out he is not the only one with an Ask Me Anything repository; there are [a whole bunch of people](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) replying to questions about them on GitHub!

## Let’s try this

I really dig this idea. I feel it’s a great way to know more about someone or to be able to ask questions in a more robust way than Twitter, and less private (so more searchable) than emails.

That’s why I created an [Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama) repository for me where you can ask me questions if you feel like it. Feel free to ask anything; code, Sass, life, hobbies, stupid, non-stupid, whatever.

![This is an excellent question](https://media.giphy.com/media/dXICCcws9oxxK/giphy.gif)

I already replied to about [20 questions](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) so far, among which you’ll learn that:

- [I roughly spend 62.5% of my time working](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues/15),
- [I have spent an average of 36% of my life in my bed](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues/12),
- [my superpower would definitely be _teleportation_](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues/4),
- [I don’t believe in God](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues/14),
- [I enjoy a solid workflow](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/ama/issues/17).

And much more! I realise this is probably something I should have done a while ago given the amount of questions I’ve been asked on Twitter / GitHub / email. Better late than never!

I also incite you to have your own repository so people can ask you questions! Let’s dig this AMA concept!
